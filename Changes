Revision history for Perl extension Term::Menu.

0.08  Sat Apr  7 18:06:00 2007
	- The module now no more uses shift, so if you call ->menu() in a loop, it won't modify your references.

0.07  Tue Mar 27 17:33:00 2007
	- Changed and updated some documentation
	- Added some tests to check order
	- Stephen Davies reported he saw a warning when they were enabled, I think I fixed this.

0.06  Tue Mar 27 09:23:00 2007
	- Moved the directory name Term-Menu to Term-Menu-0.05
	- Term::Menu now holds an array instead of a hash to preserve the order
	- Both of the changes were thanks to a hint from Kevin Montuori, thanks!

0.05  Thu Jun 08 18:57:00 2006
	- Removed dependancy for Test::Expect
	- Added check for Test::Expect to tests, if not found, all other tests are skipped.

0.04  Sun May 21 17:52:00 2006
	- The "too many tries" message now also outputs a newline at the end
	- The spaces aren't changed if hidekeys is 1 now.
	- Made a lot of new documentation.
	- Wrote the Licence section, I was too lazy to pick a licence before
